# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is my solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). Frontend Mentor challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the results summary component. I also improved my skills in using Flexbox for positioning elements and CSS custom properties for managing colors and other styles.

Here's an example of the CSS code I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

This code snippet creates a responsive grid layout where each column has a minimum width of 300px and expands to fill the available space evenly. The auto-fit value allows the grid to create as many columns as possible based on the available space.

## Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue focusing on improving my skills in responsive design and creating more complex layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques and animations to enhance the user experience. I want to also create a method for development as this was my first project, so once I got to writing alot of code I got so lost, about where stuff is going wrong, this is a very rough solution
