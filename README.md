# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is my solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). Frontend Mentor challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the results summary component. I also improved my skills in using Flexbox for positioning elements and CSS custom properties for managing colors and other styles.

Here's an example of the CSS code I'm proud of:

```css
.card-summary-section {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  position: relative;
  left: 8%;
  z-index: 0;
  margin: 20px auto;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 500px;
  height: 100%;
  max-height: 650px;
  border-radius: 10%;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.1);
  background-color: var(--white);
}

This code snippet defines the styles for a card element with the class .card-summary-section. The card is displayed as a flex container with a column direction, positioned relatively, and has a left offset of 8%. It has a z-index of 0, a margin of 20 pixels on the top and bottom, and occupies the full width and height of its container, with maximum dimensions of 500px width and 650px height. The card has a border radius of 10%, a box shadow for a subtle effect, and a background color defined by the --white CSS variable.

## Continued development

In future projects, I would like to continue focusing on improving my skills in responsive design and creating more complex layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques and animations to enhance the user experience. I want to also create a method for development as this was my first project, so once I got to writing alot of code I got so lost, about where stuff is going wrong, this is a very rough solution
